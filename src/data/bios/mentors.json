I'm currently taking CS 61B and Math 54, so if you're curious I can tell you what it's like to experience these courses in real time lol.\nIn between classes, you can find me listening to Mitski, Chappell Roan, and Kendrick Lamar, but recently I've been exploring Childish Gambino's earlier albums as well.\nI love creative writing, animation, and filmmaking, and if you ever want to talk about recent happenings in the movie/TV world I'd love to yap about it! I'm a part of UCBUGG and AFA, and I'll be sure to advertise those clubs to you if you have any interest in animation or storytelling as a whole.
