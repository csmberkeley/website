I browse reddit, twitter and youtube if that gives any idea of my personality. \n\nThe reason I became a mentor is so I can explain concepts I originally struggled on to current students, in an effort to reduce the general confusion and lack of resources regarding EE concepts. In my opinion, the ee16 series is poorly taught starting from the lectures, where concepts are introduced in such a theoretical manner. Combined with the tedious and difficult homeworks, EE can quickly become a complex subject. Yet, with exams being mostly technical questions, ee16a just becomes a matter of solidifying concepts and applying them on the tests. I hope that with some guidance, students will not have much difficulty in the class. \n",
