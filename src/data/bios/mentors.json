Although I played tennis in high school, I enjoy rock-climbing more now and playing music with others (if you ever go to a UCBSO concert you'll see me in the first violins!). I actually don't listen to that much classical music though, instead it's mainly R&B artists such as d4vid, Daniel Caeser, and Sarah Kang, and also Christian worship artists. I spend much of my weekend time with my Christian fellowship: Crossroads (yes the same as the dining hall), but otherwise, I'll be catching up on sleep. \n\nFun fact: My sleep schedule last semester was consistently sleeping from 5-7am to waking up after the sun had gone down. But! After failing the final and getting a B in Quantum Mechanics, I made the resolution to have a semi-regular sleep schedule going forward.\n\nI hope this little introduction has allowed you to get to know me a little bit, and if we end up in the same section, I'll be looking forward to learning more about you too!",

I am an amazing Spotify stalker and have grown very attached to the Spotify jam feature. I also love exploring new restaurants and cafes in UCB--even if it's bad, at least I can use a new filter color to organize into my UCB campus notion page. Especially while in Berkeley, I've been wanting to go to more concerts. My all time favorite concerts have been the 1975, Kendrick Lamar & Baby Keem, and Sabrina Carpenter. I'm also going to a Zayn concert soon! I hope to see all the 1D boys' solo career concerts at least once.",
