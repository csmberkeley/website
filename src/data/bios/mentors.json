        "details": "Hey, I’m Dan! I’m someone who loves exploring new ideas, meeting interesting people, and finding creative ways to challenge myself. I’m curious by nature, and I enjoy diving into projects or experiences that push me out of my comfort zone. Whether it’s picking up a new skill, trying something I’ve never done before, or collaborating with others on a meaningful goal, I like staying active and engaged with the world around me.\n\nWhen I’m not working on something new, I’m usually balancing life with a few favorite hobbies. I love photography because it’s a way to slow down and capture little moments that most people walk right past. I’m also into basketball — both playing and watching — since it keeps me energized and sharp. Music is another big part of my life. My playlists range from Kendrick Lamar and Tyler, the Creator to Joji, Glass Animals, and a lot of chill lo-fi beats when I want to relax.\n\nSundays are my reset button. Sometimes that means catching up with friends over coffee, sometimes it’s hitting the gym, and other times it’s just taking a walk and listening to music. Food also plays a big role in how I spend my downtime. Berkeley has some amazing spots, but if I had to pick a go-to, it’s Sliver Pizza — perfect every single time.\n\nI’ve also been part of different clubs and organizations on campus, especially ones centered around creativity, teamwork, and community. These experiences gave me the chance to meet people from different backgrounds, learn new perspectives, and contribute to projects that actually meant something. I like being around motivated people and believe that’s the best way to grow and have fun at the same time.",
