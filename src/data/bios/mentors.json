Teaching is extremely important to me and I care a lot about doing my job well. Prior to Berkeley, I taught at Wolfram and did tutoring at my school. My goal as a mentor is to make students feel empowered in their own coding abilities in this class. Comp sci at Berkeley is difficult, but at no point should it feel impossible. Confidence in your own abilities is what prevents that from happening. My job is to help you build that confidence. Outside of teaching, I love doing visual art and failing miserably at video games with my friends. I'm a very friendly person who loves to talk about anything, so please don't be afraid to approach me if you need anything at all. See you in section, and good luck in CS61B!"

I really enjoyed more design focused classes like 61AB for CS(but I enjoyed CS70 too, just not my favorite CS lower div) and really enjoyed analyzing political behavior for PS. I'm originally from L.A. and then moved to the central valley and now I'm here in Berkeley(It seems I'm slowly moving up state as time goes one). Most of the time I enjoy sink my time into school. But when I'm not doing that I like to go on trips camping with my friends in California, with Yosemite definitely being my favorite or learning how to play piano to relax. My favorite musician is David Bowie(even though that choice sounds like it radiates boomer energy so for a modern artist I'll say Kanye or Tame Impala). I'm currently playing through the Ace Attorney Trilogy and Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood is goated. I like coffee to the point that it may be classified as unhealthy but not enough for me to have the other energy drinks. And though I haven't been at Berkeley enough to develop taste for a favorite restaurant I gotta say crepevine is pretty good. I look forward to helping you with one of my favorite classes I've ever had!"

As a side note: I am an AI in CS61B; if you are more familiar with Java than you are with Python, I can explain Python concepts using their counterparts in Java.",

My interests are mostly in low-level EE (power electronics and circuit design) as well as mechatronics (i.e. interfacing a mechanical system with electronic components). I hope that I can make your experience with this class be a little better, and maybe convince some people to take some EE upper division courses. At Berkeley, the club that I'm most involved with is PiE (a.k.a. Pioneers in Engineering). We host a robotics competition for underserved high schools in the Bay Area to help disadvantaged high schoolers obtain some STEM experience. In my free time, I like doing amateur astronomy, photography, and biking; I also love hanging out with friends and chatting about random stuff.
