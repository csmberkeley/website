Although I played tennis in high school, I enjoy rock-climbing more now and playing music with others (if you ever go to a UCBSO concert you'll see me in the first violins!). I actually don't listen to that much classical music though, instead it's mainly R&B artists such as d4vid, Daniel Caeser, and Sarah Kang, and also Christian worship artists. I spend much of my weekend time with my Christian fellowship: Crossroads (yes the same as the dining hall), but otherwise, I'll be catching up on sleep. \n\nFun fact: My sleep schedule last semester was consistently sleeping from 5-7am to waking up after the sun had gone down. But! After failing the final and getting a B in Quantum Mechanics, I made the resolution to have a semi-regular sleep schedule going forward.\n\nI hope this little introduction has allowed you to get to know me a little bit, and if we end up in the same section, I'll be looking forward to learning more about you too!"
