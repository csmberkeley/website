        "details": "Hello, My name is Bryan Huckleberry and I am a Junior Mentor for CS61a. I began learning how to code seriously in highschool and at Cal I have taken Data 8, CS61a, and I am currently enrolled in CS61b. I have experience coding in Java, Python, and a some VBA. I am a member of the Sigma Nu fraternal organization at UC Berkeley and I am a member of the Cal Hiking and Outdoor Society. I love the outdoors, music, and I am a huge movie buff. An interesting fact about me is that I have actually been playing guitar for 10 years, having taken lessons for 7. Some of my favorite artists include Rush, Radiohead, Tool, Muse, and Queens of the Stone Age. My intended majors are Statistics and Computer Science. My love of these subjects comes from a passion for logic and data. In fact, one of my favorite classes at Berkeley has been Philos 12A: Introduction to Logic. I've always thought that one of the best skills someone can have is good problem-solving intuition and I hope to be able to teach, through computer science mentoring, the many benefits that coding can have not only as a technical skill, but as a way to improve how one solves problems in their everyday life. I'm very excited to be starting my journey as a member of CSM and I look forward to what this ~unorthodox~ semester has to offer!"

And that\u2019s something I strive to do every day. A little about my personal side, I love playing Spikeball and often enjoy cruising down the Berkeley hills on my longboard. Not to mention, I\u2019ll always be down to set aside a couple of hours for a pleasant sunset hike.
