I used to be pre-med and have jumped around way too many majors which is why I'm pretty late to the game but happy to finally be here. Before entering into the world of Berkeley CS, I was a fiddler in a bluegrass band and spent last summer interning at the White House. Outside the classroom, I enjoy trying out new recipes, staying up way too late talking with my roommates, and getting incredibly sore from a light workout. I am making it a personal goal to enjoy this semester by making more time for friends every week. If you ever want to talk American politics or are confused about which classes to take, please reach out! Let's get this.",

When I'm not at school - I'm at the gym, playing games, or doing some of the fun activities I'm in. I like to play tennis, ice skate, and go to ballroom dance practice so definitely join my section if you like too as well! I also like to walk my dog Oscar, and take him places too. If everyone wants, he might make an appearance at some time! I'm really commited to helping people succeed even without prior programming experience and I'll help out as much as I can!

        "details": "I\u2019m a Third year EECS major from Southern California focusing on renewable power generation. When I took CS61C, I was astounded by how powerful I felt the material was for understanding/operating computers, so last term I served as an academic intern for the class on what has become a personal quest to one day be a TA and spread the excitement and understanding I\u2019ve felt for the material to incoming students. I enjoy puzzles, collecting/reading books ([particularly very fancy ones] recently those have included: a lot of manga from the anime I watch, Eight Will Fall, The Merciful Crow, King of Scars [from the author of the Six of Crows series, which is frankly gold], The Lord of the Rings [finally finished! ^<^], the bible [for historical/cultural purposes], After the Fall, The Dome in the Forest [part of the Pelbar Cycle, also gold, though slower paced], Pride and Prejudice [further gold], and the complete works of Edgar Allan Poe), video games ([especially puzzle/adventure games] Minecraft, Portal, Legend of Zelda, Sly Cooper, Crash Bandicoot, Kingdom Hearts, Smash Brothers, Pok\u00e9mon, Undertale, Super Mario), listening to music [a lot of which is also from the anime I watch, aside from the nightcore and 2 Steps from Hell Orchestral music], seeing plays/musicals, spending time with family, interacting with young children, traveling, learning about/observing animals, cooking, playing board games, cultivating non-ornamental plants and learning about plant families, drawing (whether purely creatively or referencing any of the media I consume), discussing/coming up with fair and balanced policies, trivia/learning new information in general, trying to look edgy, watching select shows that appear on television (Jeopardy, Gotham, Gravity Falls, Star vs the Forces of Evil, Over the Garden Wall, Scooby Doo, Code Lyoko), watching anime (Mekakucity Actors, YuGiOh!, RWBY, My Hero Academia, Land of the Lustrous), learning Japanese/about Japanese culture, making/planning costumes and dressing up/cosplaying, preparing for and celebrating Halloween, and\u2014most recently\u2014attending conventions for nerds like me. Whew! I think that covers what I like to do. I admire the late Monty Oum as a person for his drive and dedication to creating something to be proud of. I\u2019d say Leigh Bardugo is my favorite author, though I greatly respect Lemony Snicket, Trenton Lee Stewart, Stephenie Meyer, J.K. Rowling, Suzanne Collins, Jane Austen, and Jeanne DuPrau for the characters they made, the worlds they built, and the styles they presented. My favorite overall artist would have to be Jin for the depth he put into his songs and the story that they tell. I\u2019m a vegetarian, so my favorite restaurant in Berkeley is The Butcher\u2019s Son ([despite whatever my brother would have you believe about French restaurants in Berkeley] though it\u2019s a bit pricey). This term I have decided that I\u2019ve been doing college wrong the past 5 terms and have embarked on a journey to discover and become a part of fun clubs on campus. In the present, I plan to join the Berkeley Quizbowl club to satisfy my trivia needs, Cal Animage Alpha so I can finally discuss all the anime that I squee to myself about all week long with others and maybe squee together with them, Amigos at Berkeley so I can practice my Spanish before my family comes to visit this summer, Board Games at Berkeley so I can relax and find an acceptable space to let my cutthroat strategizing Slytherin side come out (or maybe play some co-op games ^^\u201d), potentially the Berkeley Philosophy Forum so I can discuss my ideas with other humans and get some constructive criticism that I just can\u2019t generate for myself like others do, potentially also the Pok\u00e9mon Club on campus when they have movie nights since Pok\u00e9mon movies are gold and 50 times better than the anime, and maybe also Smash at Berkeley for when they have Smash Bros tournaments [even though I know my wonderful Lucina with all of her counters, and Sheik with all of her scorpion kicks are simply not pro material, at least with me controlling them :-( ]. Hoof! Alright. I think that\u2019s everything. *blink* Well, I imagine I\u2019ve blathered far longer than you bargained for when you sat down and decided to read this. My bad ^^\u201d   ",

I am so excited to teach a group of you to help you succeed, enjoy, learn and grow in EECS classes here at Berkeley.

I love listening to jazz/indie and am currently obsessed with Tom Misch, Mac Demarco and Lifafa (check them out if you haven't). I spend my weekends eating at my favourite places in Berkeley (Imm Thai, Guacamole 61 and La Note) and watching my favourite shows (Arrested Development, The Office and the Eric Andre Show). I am also very interested in data analytics in the context of development economics and political science. I love working with non-profits and am an active member of a pro bono consulting group called the Berkeley Group. ",
