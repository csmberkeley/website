I enjoy playing tennis, piano, and various nNintendo games. There is also an incredible amount of Manga I have read in the meantime. Typically, I enjoy listening to classical Concertos and different pieces by Chopin, but I would like to expand my breadth of knowledge into more composers and instruments. Besides that, any type of music whether it be pop, jazz, rap, 80s, etc are all great to me. A normal Sunday might mean having more time to play tennis or hike the fire trails, something active at least. In my opinion, Top Dog is the best option if I have been up late studying for exams or working on projects. Even though I personally have not been in many club events, I have met many members and leaders, all of whom I think are wonderful people."
