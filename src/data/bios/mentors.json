But when I'm not doing that I like to go on trips camping with my friends in California, with Yosemite definitely being my favorite or learning how to play piano to relax. My favorite musician is David Bowie(even though that choice sounds like it radiates boomer energy so for a modern artist I'll say Kanye or Tame Impala). I'm currently playing through the Ace Attorney Trilogy and watching Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood. I like coffee to the point that it may be classified as unhealthy but not enough for me to have the other energy drinks.
